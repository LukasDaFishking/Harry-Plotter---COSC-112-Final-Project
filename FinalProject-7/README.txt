"Harry Plotter" by Jamie Kelsey, Lukas Luby-Prikot, and Jonah McDonald

This project is our curve plotter that we plan to focus on elliptic curves.

To compile run javac Main.java
To run, run java Main

To use the program simply enter inputs into the text box in the upper right and press enter. Inputs should be of the form y^n = a + bx + ... + mx^8. You can remove inputs with the x button next to them. If you enter or generate an elliptic curve, you can then chose to plot it over a prime field. Simply enter the prime you wish to use and press the button. If you entered something other than a prime number it will simply do nothing.

Zoom with either the plus or minus buttons or the a and s keys. 

Pan by clicking and dragging on the grid.
